		This website will be used to show my opinions on platinums - what I like about them, how long it took me, any advantages I gave myself, etc. I'll do my best to review almost all the games I finish. If you feel like I did something that would affect my review - i.e., do something that is practically cheating - you can contact me through the Contact page. Any other issues you have with me can be solved by you not interacting with this page.

	 <h2>	About Me	</h2>
	 <!-- Introduces self -->
	  <p>
		I'm a high school student, so, I don't spend all my time trophy hunting. I do this and coding as a hobby. I mainly use Linux for my computer's OS - I use Arch, btw - since Windows 10 is nearing End of Support, and I don't want to use Windows 11. I enjoy reading, and sometimes indulge in William Blake's poetry.

	<h2>	Enjoy!	</h2>
	<p>
		I made this website to have fun, and practice some of my coding skills. If I forget to update, blame my terrible scheduling. Don't take anything too seriously, this is all my opinion. Anything that might be wrong... is most likely wrong. If any of you know a way to incorporate PSNProfile's stuff in here automatically, please, let me know.
